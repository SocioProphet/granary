# Granary Frontend

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

However, it has more or less been _ejected_ -- the hot reload is not intended 
to be used, since all of the assets will be served from the Granary API server.

If you're here looking for development instructions, _turn around_. You can find what you need 
in the main application [README](../README.md#ui-development).
